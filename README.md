# **Data Portofolio: Faiz Naida Salimah**
## 👋 **Introduction**

Hi! I'm Faiz, an aspiring data analysis or data science professional who seeking to apply my knowledge to real-world experiences. 
Recently graduated from the bootcamp Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at Rakamin Academy, in which I got to learn end-to-end data science processes. 

This repository is containing a portfolio of data science and data analyst projects that I have completed and showcases my skills and experience in this field. My portfolio includes projects that demonstrate my ability to gather, process, and analyze large data sets, as well as my expertise in creating meaningful insights and visualizations.

### 📂 **Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner**
📍 **Description :** <br>
Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner is my self-study project that I have completed for the [8WeekSQLchallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/). 

In early 2021, Danny opened a little Japanese restaurant. I help Danny to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and also which menu items are their favorite based on sales historical data.

### 📂 **Analyzing Website Traffic and Performance**
📍 **Description :** <br>
This project is from [Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis and Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/?src=sac&kw=advanced+sql).

Maven Fuzzy Factory has been live for 8 months. The CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. I was tasked to extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the database to quantify the company’s growth.

From the analysis, we can conclude :
- E-commerce business performance is growing. The revenue conversion rate steadily increased by 3.19% from March to 4.40% in November.
- Most traffic from gsearch, nonbrand campaigns, and desktop as device type
- The landing page version of lander-1 can increase the conversion rate by 1.08% higher than the home page with an estimated addition of 64 orders per month.
- From the billing test page, the billing-2 has a larger revenue per billing page contribution with a lift of 8.51 dollars per page view. That had a positive impact on increasing revenue by 10152.43 dollars last month.

### 📂 **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention**
📍 **Description :** <br>
This was completed for Rakamin Academy's final project.

Majestic is an e-commerce company that only generated a 15% conversion rate on the website in a year. In 2020 - 2021, conversion rates in various e-commerce industries have increased by an average of 28%. This is a great opportunity for companies to increase revenue. We built a model that can predict which website visitors are probable to purchase or not. We also analyze visitor activity to gain insights to provide the ideal business recommendations.

Based on several algorithms that have been tested, Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning has the best performance. The model achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.90 and from simulation can increase the conversion rate by 58%.

### 📂 **Airline Customer Segmentation Based on LRFMC Model Using KMeans**
📍 **Description :** <br>
This project was completed for Rakamin Academy's homework.

Help airline companies to maximize profits by focusing resources and marketing on valuable customers. We built a clustering model to segment and analyze customer characteristics based on LRFMC scores using K-Means and suggest business strategy recommendations.

From the model results, 5 clusters were obtained: 26% are New Users, 20% are Loyal Customers, 19% are Potential Loyalists/The Campion, 18% are Need Attention, and 16% are Hibernating.
