### 📂 **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention**

📍 **Description :** <br>
This was completed for Rakamin Academy's final project.

Majestic is an E-commerce (marketplace) company that only generated a 15% conversion rate last year from customers who visited the website. As a data scientist team, we will do analysis to gain insight into the pattern of customer habits in browsing the website, create machine learning models that can predict customers who are likely to purchase or not and provide business recommendations based on the findings and model results.

The result with the best performance is the Random Forest algorithm with a ROC-AUC value of 0.90 with the importance features are page value, exit rates and product related. From the business simulation with the model that has been built, it will result in an increase in revenue conversion rate of 58%.

This project was completed for Rakamin Academy's homework.

Help airline companies to maximize profits by focusing resources and marketing on customers who are valuable to the company by segmenting customers based on the LRFMC model using K-Means. In addition, we analyze the characteristics of each cluster generated and provide business insights.

From the model results, 5 clusters were obtained: 26% are New Users, 20% are Loyal Customers, 19% are Potential Loyalists/Candidate Loyalists, 18% are Need Attention, and 16% are Hibernating.
