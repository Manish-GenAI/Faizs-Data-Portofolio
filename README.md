# **Project Portfolio**
### 👋 Introduction

Hi! I'm Faiz, an aspiring data analysis or data science professional who seeking to apply my knowledge to real-world experiences. 
Recently graduated from the bootcamp Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at Rakamin Academy, in which I got to learn end-to-end data science processes. 

This repository is containing a portfolio of data science and data analyst projects that I have completed and showcases my skills and experience in this field. My portfolio includes projects that demonstrate my ability to gather, process, and analyze large data sets, as well as my expertise in creating meaningful insights and visualizations.

### 📂 Predict Clicked Ads Customer Classification
*Mini Project by Rakamin Academy | Individual | [**Full Documentation**](https://github.com/faizns/Predict-Clicked-Ads-Customer-Classification) | [**Notebook**](https://github.com/faizns/Predict-Clicked-Ads-Customer-Classification/blob/main/Customer%20Clicked%20Ads%20Classification.ipynb)*<br>
<br>

📌 **Description** <br>
I successfully developed a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest model, with a high accuracy of 96% to detect potential users who are likely to click on advertisement. The key features that significantly influence the model are Daily Internet Usage, Daily Time Spent on Site, Area Income, and Age. Based on the model results, potential users who are likely to click on an ad can be identified as follows:
- Non-active internet users, characterized by spending less time on the site (less than 1 hour) and using the internet for a limited duration (with Daily Internet Usage below 2.5 hours per day).
- Market segment comprising individuals aged over 40.
- Market segment with a medium to low income level (below Rp.400 million/year).

By targeting these potential users, companies can optimize their advertising strategies and allocate their resources more effectively to achieve better conversion rates and cost efficiency.

### 📂 Predict Customer Personality to Boost Marketing Campaign
*Mini Project by Rakamin Academy | Individual | [**Full Documentation**](https://github.com/faizns/Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign) | [**Notebook**](https://github.com/faizns/Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign/blob/main/Predict%20Customer%20Personality.ipynb)*<br>
<br>

📌 **Description** <br>
Understanding customer characteristics and behaviors in transactions is crucial for setting effective marketing strategies for a company. I successfully developed a machine learning clustering model using K-means that categorized customers into 4 segments with the highest Silhouette Score of 0.535. These segments can be classified as:
- High Customer A: 12.61% of the population, characterized by high transaction and high spending. They are responsive to campaigns and have moderate website visits and conversion rates.
- High Customer B: 13.42% of the population, characterized by high income and conversion rates. They have similar spending patterns as High Customer A but have the highest income. They are moderately responsive to campaigns and have less frequent website visits.
- Moderate Customer: 23.75% of the population, characterized by moderate transaction and spending levels. They have average conversion rates, website visits, and campaign response.
- Low Customer: Dominating the population with 50.22%, this segment is characterized by low transaction and spending. They have the lowest conversion rates, less responsiveness to campaigns, but are more active in visiting the website.

### 📂 Investigate Hotel Business using Data Visualization
*Mini Project by Rakamin Academy | Individual | [**Full Documentation**](https://github.com/faizns/Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization) | [**Notebook**](https://github.com/faizns/Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Investigate_Hotel_Business.ipynb)*<br>
<br>

📌 **Description** <br>
This analysis focuses on evaluating the performance of the hotel industry using visualizations. The objective is to identify issues, weaknesses, and strengths within the hotel business by understanding customer behavior and adjusting strategies accordingly.

In summary, City Hotel dominates in customer bookings, especially during holiday seasons. Cancellation rates tend to increase with longer stays, particularly in City Hotel. Shorter lead times result in fewer cancellations, while City Hotel faces higher cancellation rates for longer lead times. Resort Hotel exhibits a consistent cancellation rate of around 40%.

### 📂 Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention
*Final Project by Rakamin Academy | Team | [**Full Documentation**](https://github.com/faizns/Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention) | [**Presentation Deck**](https://github.com/faizns/Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention/blob/main/Majestic%20Final%20Presentation.pdf) | [**Notebook**](https://github.com/faizns/Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention)*
<br>
<br>

📌 **Description** <br>
Majestic is an e-commerce company that only generated a 15% conversion rate on the website in a year. In 2020 - 2021, conversion rates in various e-commerce industries have increased by an average of 28%. This is a great opportunity for companies to increase revenue. We built a model that can predict which website visitors are probable to purchase or not. We also analyze visitor activity to gain insights to provide the ideal business recommendations.

Based on several algorithms that have been tested, Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning has the best performance. The model achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.90 and from simulation can increase the conversion rate by 58%.

<br>
<br>

📌 **Description** <br>
Our objective is to assist airline companies in maximizing profits by targeting valuable customers. We have developed a clustering model that utilizes LRFMC scores and the K-Means algorithm to analyze customer characteristics and provide business strategy recommendations.

From the model results, we have identified 5 customer clusters: 26% are New Users, 20% are Loyal Customers, 19% are Potential Loyalists/The Champion, 18% are Need Attention, and 16% are Hibernating. By understanding these customer segments, airline companies can optimize their resource allocation and marketing efforts.
